            "This app ruined my trust in my family. I felt watched constantly. It’s not safety, it’s surveillance."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "They sold my data to advertisers and location tracking companies. I never agreed to this!"
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "Life360 is marketed as safety, but in reality, it’s an invasion of privacy."
